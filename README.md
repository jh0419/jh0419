- 👋 Hi, I’m @jh0419
- 👀 I’m interested in studying programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning php, c, javascript, mysql, python etc.
- 💞️ I am studying the programming languages mentioned above, but I think it was an impractical study. So now, I am trying to study to get a more practical course, and I hope that I will get such an opportunity.
- 📫 How to reach me is via 19jh0419@gmail.com.
